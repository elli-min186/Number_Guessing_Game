# Guess the Number Game
## Overview
This is a simple console-based Python program that allows users to play a guessing game. The program generates a random number, and the user has to guess the correct number within a limited number of attempts. There are three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, each with a different range of numbers.

## How to Play
1. Run the program in a Python environment.
1. Choose a difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard.
1. You have 5 attempts to guess the randomly generated number.
1. Enter your guess within the specified range.
1. Receive feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
1. Continue guessing until you either guess the correct number or run out of attempts.
1. After the game ends, you will be asked if you want to play again.
## Levels
1. Easy: Guess a number between 1 and 10.
1. Medium: Guess a number between 1 and 20.
1. Hard: Guess a number between 1 and 40.
## Files
- guess_the_number.py: The main Python script containing the game logic.
- README.md: This readme file providing instructions and information about the game.
## How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script, and run the following command:
```
python guess_the_number.py
```
### Notes
- The game provides feedback on whether the correct number is higher or lower than your guess.
- You have 5 attempts to guess the number within each level.
- The program is case-insensitive, meaning it accepts input regardless of the case (e.g., "Easy" or "easy").
- Enjoy the game, and have fun guessing the number!
